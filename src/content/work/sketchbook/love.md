This work goes alongside the CREATION page.

It contrasts the Destruction theme of earlier and explores the different forms
love takes. Each figure represents a type of love; the bottom left showcases
the love for animals, the right-hand side shows the love of food, the top
centre is how easily a smile can cause someone to have a good day, the top
right also has a couple of music symbols to show the love of music.

Medium - Oil pastels
