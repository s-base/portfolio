> This was a trilogy of works on pink Post-it notes.

I always like drawing more personal ideas on Post-it notes to contrast the
single-use and disregard they have to my own thoughts.
They explore the natural process of growth leading to the eventual death of
all of us and the power God has given us to be able to learn and grow.
