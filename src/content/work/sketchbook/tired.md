This is a WIP. The theme is how over the years people grow more tired and
reminisce on their youth more often.

The caption reads

> Talking? I was talking once too. I liked to talk all day and night

The talking refers to the figure when they where younger and always wanting to
talk and partake in something but now they listen.

Medium - Gouache
