This work is a mix of themes from addiction seen on the right-hand side with
the caption - sips of destruction- and below that -At the End. This can
contrast the text -Creation-  as you are destroying yourself but it can also
show the creation of a bad habit or creation of destruction.

Medium - Oil pastels
