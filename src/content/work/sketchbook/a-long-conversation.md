This work is a mood page based on the conversation that was
happening between my family whilst I drew. All the faces were of the people I
could see before me and my dog, the objects were: a vase, glasses and a train ticket.
The words are in Spanish which is my native tongue that my family speaks in.

Medium - Red biro, Blue biro, Red felt tip pen
