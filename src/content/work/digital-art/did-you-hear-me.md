This page was dedicated to my own Spiderman character whom I thought of called
Kalir.

On the far left -is the backstory- I drew two figures one is drowning and
another appears unconscious floating upwards. The woman below is Kalir's mother
who couldn't swim when she fell into the ocean with Kalir.

The text -Did you hear- represents how Kalir is always surrounded by negative
influences such as abusing her power and status. The top shows a head shot of
her and half of her face is only her skull. The right side shows her suit and
full body where she is half-fleshed and half skeleton.

Medium - Krita
