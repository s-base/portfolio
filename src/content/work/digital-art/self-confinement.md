This work represents how internally we hide how we truly feel behind a mask,
hence the name self-confinement.

The middle figure represents the mask of lies that I feel I use often.
The bottom left corner is a smaller childlike figure with the same mask showing
how from a young age we are taught to hide how we truly view ourselves leading
us to be stuck between two personalities. The death head moth here is an omen
of death, I included it to show how many people never truly know each other
until in their last moments before death.

Medium - Krita
