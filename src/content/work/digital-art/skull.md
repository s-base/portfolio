This is a WIP Skull that represents a greater evil.

The skull is semi-fleshed to appear more creepy and uninviting.
The rest of the drawing will include a small little boy holding a candle
showing how no matter how horrible a situation appears there is always
love and joy in all that we do.

Medium - Krita
