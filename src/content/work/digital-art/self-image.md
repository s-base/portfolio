This work is a mood page showing how sometimes I feel I'm living in an oppressive
loop and need time to stop and admire the simple things around me.

I took some pictures of myself in my kitchen and used them for reference.
I sometimes like to read in detail the covers of different products to break my
routine and it results often learning something new, other times I sit to think
about my day or to process any conflicting thoughts or emotions.

The two of the texts say

> Haven't I given enough

and

> Always the fool with the slowest heart But I know you'll take me with you
> we'll live in spaces between walls

This is from a song called Gilded Lily that embodied my thoughts whilst making
this.

The last text says

> Stuck in a loop going over and over and over and overâ€¦

This was a repeated phrase that I felt was in my head.
