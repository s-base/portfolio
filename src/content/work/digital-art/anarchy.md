This was a mood page featuring how I view the movie V for Vendetta.
I took various quotes while watching the movie and chose a hyena for my central
piece as they are always viewed as greedy and selfish but a hyena mother is
considered one of the best mothers in the animal kingdom. This shocked me and I
saw hyenas as the new voice of the younger generation that at a glance are seen
as power-hungry but in reality, we want a more stable future for us and our descendants.
