I created a skeleton with a ribcage holding small colourful flowers inside.
I surrounded the skeleton in various lines and colours to appear as if it were
electrocuted.

I was inspired by many sci-fi movies that show the creation of new types of
life, like new plants or species. The left background is a small poem repeated
that explains how sometimes for life to be made death has to come too, the
right background is an eye and the word creation and another poem I wrote.

Medium - Krita
