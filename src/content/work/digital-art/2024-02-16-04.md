All the elements in blue represent the addiction.
The butterflies represent the illusion of freedom disguised as a trap that the
person experiences. The cigarette embodies addiction in this piece The heart
is detached from the body showing how something always feels out of place or
missing when in that cycle of addiction. The light from the lamp represents
the people who comfort and aid the person. The plant in the top corner
represents the growth that comes after an addiction ends since we always
learn from our past.

The quote says

> We are all addicted to something that takes the pain away- I wanted to show
> that not only the most common destructive addictions there are more concealed
> addictions like craving any validation from others.
