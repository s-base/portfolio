> This was the first animation I have ever attempted.

My theme was creating a cat and duck walk and being surprised when the small cricket jumps high.
I faced lots of struggles and realised the effort that goes into producing any sort of animation.
I followed various videos on YouTube to have a foundation understanding of how to get around the
frames and smoother movements.

Medium - Krita
