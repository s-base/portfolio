I created a mood page where I explore how I feel out of place internally, in
society, in school, and amongst older generations.
The central figure is seen with headphones like I often wear to show how
sometimes music conveys many feelings that I can't express.
At the top a figure is trying to hug a bleeding heart, showing how many people
still love me despite all my flaws and to see me heal and go far in life.

Medium - Krita
