Here are a collection of head shots of two of my favourite characters called
Cissa and Alice, they are originally from the HP franchise during the
Marauders era.

The text says

> Did you hear us fall to our demise

It summarises how these two female figures are forgotten and silenced despite
suffering as much as their husbands and families during the war.

Medium - Krita
