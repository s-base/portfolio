This work was a tribute to my belief in Virgin Mary.

I based this work on Mary's apparition to a man -Juan Diego-, a man of Aztec
descent who had converted to Christianity, on December 9, 1531.

The quote says

> Mary treasured all these things in her heart

It is from the Bible, Luke 2:19.

The small flame represents a human soul that stays near Mary to be calmed and
comforted.

Medium - Krita
